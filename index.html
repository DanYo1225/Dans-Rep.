    <h2>
        <span>ABOUT ME:</span>
        <p>I am currently a Service Technician who does freelance Web Development whenever I can. I started my journey in Software Engineering about 7 years ago with HTML and CSS. I hadnt picked up Javascript ubtil about 3 years back. Life changes had slowed my progress, but i was determined to get back where i left off. It was always my dream to develop an A.I. app that does all kinds of things(feel free to ask at our in person interview). With that idea in mind i decided to spend all my time getting to understand Pseudo code to help aid in understanding more programming language and the world of Computer Science.</p>

    <h3>
        <span>SKILLS:</span>
        <P>I've spent most of my career doing almost everything construction, which i believe made me develop the need to fix things. This is what i think brought me around to coding. Since Getting back into web Developmenti have expanded my education expanigd my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Float, and Flexbox. I am striving towards my dream of creating that A.I. application. </P>
